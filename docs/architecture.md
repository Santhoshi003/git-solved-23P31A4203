# System Architecture

## Overview

DevOps Simulator follows a flexible microservices architecture designed for high availability, scalability, and AI/ML integration. It supports multi-cloud deployments and chaos engineering with experimental features while maintaining stable production and development configurations.

## Core Components

### 1. Application Server

- *Technology*: Node.js + Express (with TensorFlow.js augmentation in experimental)
- *Ports*:
  - 8080 (production)
  - 3000 (development with hot reload)
  - 9000 (experimental main)
  - 9001 (experimental metrics)
  - 9002 (experimental AI API)
- *Scaling*:
  - Horizontal auto-scaling enabled (production)
  - Manual single instance (development)
  - AI-powered predictive auto-scaling (experimental)
- *Debug*: Chrome DevTools debugger on port 9229 (development)
- *Message Queue*: Apache Kafka for event streaming (experimental)
- *Intelligence*: Real-time ML inference (experimental)

### 2. Database Layer

- *Database*: PostgreSQL 14
- *Configuration*:
  - Master-slave replication (production)
  - Single instance (development)
  - Multi-master replication with 5-node cluster (experimental)
- *Cache*: Redis cluster with ML-based cache optimization (experimental)
- *Backup*:
  - Daily automated backups (production)
  - Manual backups (development)
  - Continuous geo-redundant backups (experimental)
- *AI Features*: Query optimization, index suggestions (experimental)
- *Seeding*: Auto-seed with test data on startup (development)

### 3. Monitoring and Observability

- *Tools*:
  - Prometheus + Grafana (production)
  - Basic console logging + optional Prometheus (development)
  - Prometheus + Thanos for long-term storage (experimental)
  - ELK Stack + AI log analysis (experimental)
- *Metrics*: CPU, Memory, Disk, Network, Build time (development)
- *Alerts*: Email notifications (production), Console warnings (development), Anomaly alerts (experimental)
- *Dashboard*: Web dashboard (development and experimental)

### 4. Container & Cloud Orchestration

- *Development only*:
  - Docker Compose for app, database, Redis cache
  - Volume mounts for hot reload
- *Experimental*:
  - Kubernetes with custom CRDs
  - Global anycast load balancing
  - Multi-cloud failover

### 5. Authentication System (Beta, Development Only)

- OAuth2 + JWT authentication
- Providers: Google, GitHub (testing)
- Redis-based session storage

## Deployment Strategy

- Production: Rolling updates, zero downtime, automated rollback on failure
- Development: Docker Compose hot reload, rollback via Git checkout, zero downtime not applicable

## Development Workflow

1. Make code changes
2. Auto-reload triggers rebuild
3. Run unit tests
4. Check console logs
5. Commit when ready

## Security

- Production: SSL/TLS encryption, encrypted database connection, regular security audits
- Development: SSL/TLS disabled, plain-text database credentials, CORS open, debug endpoints exposed

## Experimental Features (Development Only)

- Multi-cloud deployment
- AI-powered log analysis
- Automatic rollback on anomaly detection
